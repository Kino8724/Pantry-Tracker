**In-House Food Tracker**
----------
**Concept**
I want to create a program that will allow you to scan the barcodes on the food you have into a database to then keep track of it and know what you need. This program will have multiple sections that will keep track of different things (Fridge & Pantry). I want it to be able to keep track of items you choose and when you get below a certain amount then it will add to a shopping list that you can reference next time you go to put in an order. It will be a webapp so that you can use it on any phone or computer as long as you have a browser. Potentially use a Raspberry Pi to create an auto scanner.

**Requirements** 
- database
- website front end to allow the user to interface with it 
- learn how barcodes work
----------
**Flowchart of use** 
1. scan items in (Tell it to add) 
2. go to webapp and set your minimum threshhold for items
3. scan and use the item (Tell it to remove)
4. Once you reach the minimum threshhold, it will add to shopping list
5. shop online and reference shopping list section of webapp
